## Gameplay Loop

- Built around short rhythm mini-games similar to **Rhythm Heaven**.
- Each stage opens with a quick practice so players learn the rhythm.
- Tap or press buttons in sync with the beat during the main section.
- Accuracy is graded as *Perfect*, *Good*, or *Miss* and rolled into a final rank.
- Results show ranks like "Superb," "OK," or "Try Again," unlocking the next stage when cleared.

## Running the Prototype

Install dependencies with pip and run the game script:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
